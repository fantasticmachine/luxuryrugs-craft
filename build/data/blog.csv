If you have a specific design, colour scheme or size in mind, this is the way to go. But how does it work? Well, to start, you will have to choose the dimensions of the rug. You also could, for example, choose a smaller rug that you love, and replicate in a bigger size. You can then choose the quality of the craftsmanship itself, ranging from hand-knotted to hand-hooked.

For homeowners who live in <a href=""https://www.google.co.za/maps/place/Kensington,+London,+UK/@51.4959297,-0.2100279,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48760ff450741237:0xedc3db547037295e!8m2!3d51.5010095!4d-0.1932794?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kensington</a>, custom rugs are just a phone call away. After you choose the quality, it’s time to choose the material. Depending on the company you work with, you can pick silk, wool or a combination of the two. Then, it’s time to pick the design. You will be able to choose from a variety of pre-made designs, or work with the company’s experts to create a design that suits you. With the design out of the way, it’s time to choose the colour scheme, the fringes of the rug, and the carving or pile height.

These are the initial steps of the design process when you commission custom rugs in Kensington. The next step involves sampling. The company will create a small segment of the rug and send it to you for feedback. If the design, colouration and feel of the rug are approved, the crafting process begins. Some companies will send you pictures of the process as it evolves, while others do not. Finally, once the rug is completed, it is either sent to your home, or you are contacted in order to collect it. For more information on the custom rug making process, <a href=""http://luxuryrugs.com/contact/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact Luxury Rugs</a> today.

For the selective home owner in  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutsford"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Knutsford</a>, silk rugs must be chosen according to your preferences, taste and budget. These unique pieces are certainly not for the rough and tumble of daily use. Traditionally, Persian and Oriental silk rugs have been the most valuable and intricately hand-knotted pieces made by master craftsmen. Silk, though delicate and fine, is a strong and resilient fibre that can last for generations provided you take good care of it. One of the most striking things about silk rugs is that the seemingly fragile silk threads allow more knots to be made per square inch. This means you get a clearer and finer delineation of the pattern and detailing compared to other materials. However, you will need professional cleaning to keep your rug looking its best.

Pure silk rugs in Knutsford are 100% silk fibre from warp to weft in the weave with a silk foundation and these are the most valuable of silk rugs. Other varieties include wool with silk detailing, which gives them extra depth and pile. Silk foundations may also be used with wool. Some silk rugs may have a cotton foundation. When you are looking for the finest quality silk rugs, <a href=""http://luxuryrugs.com/contact/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact Luxury Rugs</a>.

With an extensive variety of individual tastes, you’ll be sure to find something to your liking with us. In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_London"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chelsea</a>, wool rugs come in a variety of colours, patterns, styles and designs so whatever your preference or desire, you won’t have to compromise on the scheme used in a room. Wool is soft underfoot and keeps a room well insulated from heat and sound, making sure you’re always comfortable. They are stain resistant and much easier to clean than other synthetic rugs. This property is attributed to the natural coating of light wax on its fibres. Wool rugs are also healthy in that they won’t irritate anyone who has respiratory health conditions such as asthma. They also won’t harbour dangerous creatures such as dust mites, small creatures that are able to live in soft furnishings. This also prevents allergic reactions like eczema from flaring up, especially for those who are susceptible to it. Wool fibre is flame resistant, making rugs made from this material ideal for any room, including your children’s room. Purchasing a wool rug will be cost-efficient as they are durable and can last for many years.

It’s time to make a statement in your home with wool rugs in Chelsea.

They are able to last for a longer period of time without succumbing to wear and tear unlike their counterparts.

At Luxury Rugs, we believe<!--more--> that a few well-chosen statement pieces like this can provide sophistication and opulence in any room. Silk provides that unmistakable softness and sheen and it also gives the craftsman better control over design. That's why you get finer details in silk carpets and rugs than with other materials like wool. It's rarely used in floor covering products because it's expensive and tends to absorb moisture, stains easily and can get damaged. However, with care and good maintenance, you can keep your silk rug looking bright and fresh. China was one of the countries where silk rugs were traditionally woven and many carpets and rugs purchased centuries ago are still in existence. As a fabric, silk is quite tough and has a (tensile) pulling strength higher than that of a similar filament of steel! It is also relatively flame resistant.

These rugs immediately draw attention to themselves and give your room a memorable and distinctive look. Many people assume that “modern” means new – however, in this case, it refers to the design element. Many vintage Oriental rugs fall into this category because of their geometric motifs and strong colours. Just a single well-chosen piece can ramp up your style quotient from boring to amazing!

Silk is usually a material associated with women’s fashion and accessories, such as scarves. It is, however, a remarkably versatile natural fabric that makes excellent carpets and rugs too. Silk carpets do perform differently to carpets made from other materials like wool or synthetic fibre. Silk tends to absorb moisture and can stain easily, which is why it is usually preferred for statement areas and not high traffic floors. On the other hand, silk has an unparalleled softness and sheen, is lightweight and has a tensile strength higher than steel of an equivalent filament count, making it both pretty and tough. Pure silk is also non-flammable.

If you want stunning floors for your home or office in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">London</a>, silk rugs offer a variety of stylistic choices. A silk carpet can have much finer details than other carpets, as the manufacturing process allows better control over design elements without the need for printed patterns. At Luxury Rugs we supply the finest quality silk rugs in all styles and purposes, from modern to traditional. Our silk rugs are designed and produced by the most skilled weavers and craftspeople from around the world. Many of our luxury silk rugs are one-of-a-kind, offering the ultimate exclusivity in style. As a boutique rug company, we have clients all across the world as well as locally, from homeowners to private jets, luxury cruise ships and five star hotels.

Make a statement with silk rugs in London. Choose a bold solid colour or a hued pattern piece for that statement area in your home or business. We can also arrange custom rugs to fit unconventional shapes or areas, such as curved walls or asymmetrical atriums. <a href=""https://luxuryrugs.com/blog/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contact Luxury Rugs</a> for silk rugs that add a new level of sophistication and style to any floor.

The crafting of the rug is usually done one of three ways; Hand-knotted, flat weave and hand tufted. Hand knotted and hand tufted rugs have a pile and both are highly labour intensive to create. Flat weave rugs are flat, have no pile and get their depth from an attached backing. Most handmade rugs are made from natural fibres like jute, silk, wool and cotton.

On the surface, that appears to be true but then a machine made rug is not likely to be considered an investment. Your handmade rug could gain in value over time especially if the artisan is well respected. Likely your handmade rug will last for decades and look good doing it which makes it a bargain even though you pay more today. Because artisans consider their handmade rugs an expression of their art, they use only the highest quality materials. Artist are only satisfied with perfection.

Choosing the right area rugs can be challenging, because of the size and space limitations. In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">London,</a> modern rugs provide a touch of contemporary chic to homes, offices, yachts, private aircraft, boutique hotels, and clubs. They have to blend in with the architectural and interior design style yet offer a distinctive style statement of their own. It’s your choice whether you want them to make a bold appearance, like floor artworks, or whether you want them to stay in the background as a subtle touch of quiet elegance in the room. Often, your rug can completely transform the ambiance in the room with colour and design elements that are unique and reflect your own taste and personality. You can choose a particular rug style like floral, abstract, geometric, earthy jute and sisal. It’s not important that everything in the room “matches.” However, it’s wise to make a selection based on textures and tones of the upholstery and furniture.

Patterned modern rugs in London are bold, attractive and striking. They can bring your room to life and make it look interesting, warm, inviting and exciting.

Rugs are also multi-functional. Other than serving to bring a particular design aspect to life, they can also be a source of warmth when placed on a floor that is made of materials that do not generally retain heat. Rugs can also serve as barriers to scuff marks that may appear on the floor after extended periods of dragging small pieces of furniture like coffee tables from one point to another.

For your home in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kensington</a>, luxury rugs will add style and pizzazz. These rugs are made using high quality materials that, in turn, make them more durable and suitable for long term use. Luxury rugs come made in a wide range of sizes and colours to suit an equally diverse set of tastes. Luxury rugs can serve to bring out and emphasise the décor of a room. They can also serve as an anchor for contrasting design aspects that have been placed around the room, so that, rather than clashing, they find symmetry through the addition of the rug. Luxury rugs can also be the secret employed to enhancing the overall feel of a room. You can use a quality, high-end rug, to make the furniture that has been placed within the room seem as though it is equally as expensive. The fact that your furniture did not cost so much can be your little secret.

Luxury rugs in Kensington are the secret to that truly sophisticated look in your home. Sourcing them, therefore, can spell the difference between well-executed interior design and a flop.

A tremendous amount of larvae and time goes into creating one silk rug. Each requires more knots per square inch to create and they have always been favoured by royalty. Those are three reasons silk rugs have a high price tag. Price tag aside, silk rugs can be dyed gorgeous colours and woven into breath-taking designs. There is another way to make silk and that is from bamboo cellulose. The only difference between bamboo silk and that made from insect larva is how it’s made.

As you might expect, silk rugs are not for every home. In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightsbridge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Knightsbridge</a>, silk rugs require a display area that does not get foot traffic. In fact, some people prefer to hang them as a tapestry. Whichever you choose, the silk rug adds its own luxury to your home. Cleaning silk rugs must be undertaken with care because water, detergents, rotating head vacuum cleaners will all damage the rugs fibres. So to clean the rug, use a vacuum without a power head and vacuum every two weeks or so. You could also take them out and shake them; just don’t try to beat the dirt out of them. A silk rug is a room accent that brings luxurious aesthetics to your home decor. The durability and longevity will depend on where it’s placed and how it’s cared for.

When it comes to natural fibres, silk rugs in Knightsbridge are the most labour intensive, most beautiful, and most expensive rug you will likely find. If you are on a budget and have a lot of foot traffic but you still want luxury along with strength and durability consider a wool and silk blend. While both fibres are soft and pleasant to the touch, a blend of the two is just a little different to the discerning touch and eye. <a href=""https://luxuryrugs.com/blog/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contact Luxury Rugs</a> or visit our showroom.

It is considered to be more versatile than other rug materials due to its natural fibre properties. While silk is lightweight, it has a tensile strength greater than steel when matched filament to filament, making it supremely tough and and long-lasting. Silk rugs are, however, recommended as statement pieces where they will not experience heavy foot traffic. Their tensile strength means they resist wear and tear well, but silk is also absorbs moisture, making them prone to stains and superficial damage. With the stunning visual qualities of silk rugs available, you will certainly want them as statement pieces though.

If you are looking for decor to improve your home or office in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiswick"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chiswick</a>, silk rugs are an excellent choice. They cannot be matched for their soft texture and luminous lustre. Woven from natural silk fibre, these rugs offer much finer details and patterns than other woven materials. The advanced control this allows during the manufacture process means that patterns and colours can be woven into the rug itself, eliminating the need for printed designs post-weave. This also means that there is a wide variety of silk rug designs and patterns available, from classic traditional to contemporary and alternative.

You can find gorgeous silk rugs in Chiswick in any style imaginable at Luxury Rugs. We are a boutique rug company that sources the finest quality silk rugs from master weavers around the world.

The first is noise reduction. Our rugs are capable of significantly decreasing the noise level in your home. Rugs are much quieter and softer to walk than a hardwood floor. As a result, it can absorb sounds in the air. Simply pay attention to the sounds in a room with only hardwood flooring. You will hear an echo; but not so in a carpeted space. The second obvious benefit of a luxury rug is comfort. A carpet is much more pleasant to walk on than tile or hardwood flooring. The softness of carpet fibres also makes it flexible which is why it can withstand the impact of constant footsteps. This helps to remove some of the pressure from your body. Lastly, without a doubt, a luxury rug provides warmth. The fibres in a rug provide insulating value, particularly the padding underneath the rug. Just recall how it feels to walk on wood flooring versus a rug during the winter. The latter definitely feels much better!

Carpets that have generally been made from natural fibres are durable, easy to maintain and are considered to be good investments. The natural sheen, feel and colours with the added quality of being versatile enough to blend well with both natural and synthetic fibres give our luxury silk rugs a quality that is unmatched. The feel of a soft, silk carpet under your feet, its elegance and beauty of design make for a uniquely different experience. Some heritage designs and techniques used in their weaves categorize them into exotic works of art!

Silk rugs by Luxury Rugs are uniquely designed. In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_London"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chelsea</a>, silk rugs are manufactured from special blends of materials to increase the versatility and affordability. Silk fibres are mixed with cotton to derive cotton silk, while more rough textured finishes are achieved with jute or wool. These techniques have been perfected with the help of our skilled and hugely talented craftsmen. Synthetics, including viscose, are also used to create new products like art or faux silk. Our weavers skilfully combine design with coloured yarn to create exclusive patterns, which we guarantee are one of a kind.

Handmade carpets will not have the same uniformity of machine-made carpets and that is a large part of their charm.

Our team of experts will keep you fully updated throughout the order process, produce drawings of the projected style and the way it would look once made.

For discriminating buyers, we should be your first and last stop. All Brink &amp; Campman Rugs get their start in Holland where the company is based. Brink &amp; Campman has been manufacturing luxury quality rugs for well over a century. They have a factory based in the Netherlands where modern rugs are designed following modern trends and then manufactured using old world craftsmanship. There’s a new collection every Fall and each is stamped with Made in Holland. We are proud to recommend the Brink &amp; Campman collections to our clients. Their name is known worldwide.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brink &amp; Campman rugs are sought after because of their old world quality and bold modern colours and abstract designs. They also offer a broad range of prices so customers enjoy their affordable splash of joyful colours and designs even more. Their signature rugs are made using a traditional weaving process on Axminister looms which creates a quality the company calls Rocks. The rugs are very strong, made from thick wool enhanced by the felting process.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The felting process is an ancient craft but still used today to transform wool density by bonding and shrinking the fibres together. They add eucalyptus fibres to the wool which adds a natural lustre. Many of Brink &amp; Campman rugs design colours are created using the space dye process. Each strand of yarn is dyed in two or more colours to create a particular colour design once woven. </span>

We are well versed in their creative process and quality control so the customer knows exactly the quality of the product they are buying.
